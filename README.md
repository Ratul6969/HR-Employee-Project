Raw Employee Data into Strategic Insights

This project involved analyzing employee attendance data from Atliq Technologies using **Power BI**. The dataset included metrics such as work-from-home patterns, sick leave, and daily activity trends. Key insights revealed correlations between certain days of the week and employee absenteeism, providing actionable recommendations to enhance employee support strategies. Through this project, we came to know that Monday has the highest presence%, Friday has the highest work from home% and Monday has the highest sick leave%. 

Through this project, I honed skills in **data analysis**, **visualization**, and **communicating findings effectively**. The analysis underscores the power of data-driven decision-making to improve organizational efficiency and support.
